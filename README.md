# BibleViewFX #

This is an non-trivial Java FX project written using NetBeans 24 and OpenJavaFX 23+
to loosely resemble the BibleDesktop application from Crosswire. Considerable liberty
has been exercised to update code for Java 23+ and OpenJavaFX 23+ and to enhanse the
error reporting and logging using log4j and slf4j logging faciities.

### Purpose ###

* This is a Linux development project using maven on Apache NetBeans 24+
  This is a pre-alpha version still in development.

### Requirements ###

* Java SDK 17+
* OpenJavaFX 23+
* Azul JavaFX Runtime 23+
* Maven
* SceneBuilder 23+
* JD-GUI 
* Crosswire Source libraries v2.0+
* The file layout is using the default Maven file structure

### Contribution guidelines ###
* Contributors are preferred to be Linux or Mac users. Windows development and considerations will follow a Beta release
* Contributors should know Open JavaFX, SceneBuilder, FXML, Maven, log4j, slf4j, JD-GUI, and Apache NetBeans 24+
* .pgn, .gif, and .svg scaled images. bitmapped images are not recommended
* Graphic design for project icon is welcome in .svg or .pgn format using GIMP, INKSCAPE, or similar. (no windows only formats)
* Git, GitCola, GitKraken or similar to submit changes to repo
* Contact the repo owner for access to contribute
* Documentation is designed for Doxygen not JavaDoc. Although Doxygen can produce some JavaDoc output
